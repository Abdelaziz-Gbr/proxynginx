# proxynginx

A lightweight and flexible reverse‑proxy solution using **Nginx**, designed for simple deployment and routing of services.

## 🧰 Features

- Easy setup of Nginx as a reverse proxy for your services  
- Support for routing HTTP(s) traffic to internal services  
- Optional SSL/TLS configuration via certificates  
- Minimal dependencies and lightweight footprint  
- Configuration driven by simple files or environment variables  
- Ideal for development, home labs, or simple production use

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites  
- Linux or Unix‑based system  
- Docker & Docker Compose (optional, for containerized deployment)  
- Or a native Nginx installation  
- A domain or sub‑domain pointing to the proxy server  
- (Optional) SSL certificate and key for HTTPS  

### Installation & Usage  
1. Clone the repository  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Abdelaziz-Gbr/proxynginx.git
   cd proxynginx
   ```

2. Copy or edit the `nginx.conf` and site configuration files in `sites-available/`.  
   ```bash
   cp sites-available/example.conf sites-available/myservice.conf
   ```

3. Enable the site (if using classic Debian/Ubuntu layout)  
   ```bash
   ln -s ../sites-available/myservice.conf sites-enabled/
   ```

4. Start (or reload) Nginx  
   ```bash
   sudo nginx -t && sudo nginx -s reload
   ```

   Or if using Docker Compose:  
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

5. Point your domain/sub‑domain at the proxy server’s public IP. The configured backend service will be accessible through the proxy.

## 🧪 Example Usage

```text
Your domain: service.example.com  
Proxy config forwards http(s)://service.example.com → http://127.0.0.1:8080  
```

With SSL enabled (via `ssl/cert.crt` and `ssl/cert.key`), the connection will be secure.

## ✅ Why This Project Is Useful

- Lets you use a **single public endpoint** to expose multiple internal services via different hostnames or paths  
- Keeps your backend services hidden behind the proxy layer — good for security and separation  
- Very lightweight compared to full‑blown API gateways or service meshes  
- Great for home labs, small microservice setups, or when you need straightforward HTTP routing  

## 🛠️ Future Enhancements & Ideas

- Automated certificate management (e.g., via Let’s Encrypt)  
- WebSocket support and path‑based routing  
- Health‑checks and automatic fail‑over / load balancing  
- Logging and metrics (expose Nginx status, access logs)  
- Docker image build and deployment, with templated configs  
- GUI or CLI helper to manage proxy rules  

## 👥 Contributing

Contributions are absolutely welcome. Here’s how to get started:

1. Fork the repository  
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature-xyz`)  
3. Make your changes and commit with clear messages  
4. Push the branch and open a Pull Request  
5. Ensure you test the configuration and describe any new feature or fix
